#Here are the commands to generate a new ssh key so that ssh login does not require password from this client machine
#This enables the use of scp and sftp scripts to transfer files securely
#Note to self: I'm assuming that this needs to be done every time my IP address changes
#Note to self: I've only used it once, so not sure if second command will overwrite old key - so check that
ssh-keygen -d
scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub iomass.com:.ssh/authorized_keys2
