ABOUT C PROGRAMS I'VE WRITTEN

cli_chess.c - Watch Out Deep Blue! This is Command Line Chess! 
Play the Computer! Have the Computer play itself!
The logic has the computer looking ahead a couple moves, so it's not trivial, but
it isn't a very good chess player. This taught me a lot about the C language.

cli_chess - version compiled on chromebook with gcc (debian 8.3.0-6) 8.3.0

fibonacci.c - This just prints out the nth Fibonacci number. 

fibonacci - version compiled on chromebook with gcc (debian 8.3.0-6) 8.3.0

mandelbrot.c - This creates an image of the Mandelbrot Fractal at any depth. Fun
program! This does require NetPBM to be installed on your system. It creates
a primitive PPM image and converts it to JPEG, so you may need another converter
as well.

mandelbrot compiled does not exist here because you need to compile with NetPBM
